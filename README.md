# Helldivers 2 Stratagem Lookup

This tool is meant as a way to test stratagem codes (for examples in macros), or for finding out either what a stratagem code does, or what a stragem's code is.

The tool is hosted via GitHub Pages at https://www.stratagem-lookup.eu/.

# Contributing

Contributions will be gladly accepted, especially in terms of keeping up with new stratagem additions!

Any code changes need to be wrapped in a pull request before being merged into the main branch, directly pushing commits to main is disabled.
